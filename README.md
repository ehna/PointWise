# PointWise
The code shown below can be used to acquire the first and second harmonic responses in both vertical and lateral modes as a function of driving voltage by compiling this procedure forAsylum Research (AR) software.

How to do?

Performing point-wise measurement:
  -Load AR software and select few points you want to perform on.
  -Make sure you know the vertical and lateral resonance frequencies and the necessary tune width
  -eneter all the parameters (similar to AR parameters) and press "Measure Curves".
  -the code start the get Vertical #1 harmonic tune, Vertical #2 harmonic tune, Lateral #1 harmonic tune , and lateral #2 tunes on each       point while incrementing the drive amplitudes. The same process will be repeated on the next point.
  -Make sure tunes look good
  
  
 For post-processing
  -load the data first
  -enter the name of the data you want to analyze on Basename area
  - enter the points you want to average on
  -press "Process data"
